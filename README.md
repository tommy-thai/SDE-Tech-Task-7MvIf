# Senior Data Engineer Tech Task

## Introduction
This is the attempt to complete the assigned task by applicant Preeti Sharma.
The database application used:
local sqlite3

## Getting Started
1. I started by cloning the git repo.
2. I then installed sqlite3 on my computer.
3. I attempted the Additional SQL Challenge first dedidated steps to create the database are included in the schema_setup.sql db folder
4. I downloaded the .CSV file from the given google sheets link and formatted the date to YYYY-MM-DD format to work with my sqlite commands. Thes rest of the .CSV file formatting remains unchanged.

## Task Attempted
### ETL Challenge
Unattempted
### Analysis Challenge
I have attempted the first 2 analysis tasks not the 3rd. The SQL queries are attatched to teh righful SQL folder.
### Additional SQL challenge
I have attempted and completed the 3 SQL tasks with detailed steps taken,evidence and SQL queries attatched to the righful folder.


## Deliverables
1. [ ] **Python ETL** - A Python ETL pipeline script `main.py` that is ready to run.
2. [ ] **DB file(s)** - If you used a local DB platform, include all relevant DB files. 
3. [ ] **Unit Tests** - A collection of unit tests for your ETL pipeline.
4. [ ] **SQL** - SQL schema creation file and any additional SQL query files.
5. [ ] **SQL Answers** - Answers to the SQL analysis challenge questions in a Markdown file, including the SQL queries used.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. [ ] **Code Quality**: Efficient data manipulation with Python and SQL. Clear, well-structured code that follows best practice to a reasonable extent.
2. [ ] **SQL Proficiency**: Demonstrate query optimization and complexity in SQL through the analysis challenge.
3. [ ] **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle potential errors or irregularities in inputs.
4. [ ] **Testing**: Include unit tests to verify each part of the ETL process.
5. [ ] **Documentation**: A clear README.md that explains setup, execution, any assumptions made, and any other information you would include in a README.
